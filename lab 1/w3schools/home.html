<!-- What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
<!-- Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
-->
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

<!-- HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
Example-->
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h6>This is heading 3</h6>

<!-- HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:-->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<!--HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:-->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
<!--HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes: -->
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

<!--Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:-->
Example
<html>
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph
<p>This is a paragraph
</body>
</html>

<!--The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
Example-->
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

<!-- All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
-->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
 
<!--The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
Example-->
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

<!--The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:-->
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
