        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at <em>0</em>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing.</em> Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each <em>wrong answer</em> making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger.</strong><br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <em>growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it.<br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet.</em><br>
        Because the most <strong>beautiful, complex concepts</strong> in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>

        <p>
        You only have to know <strong>one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
